			<strong>"Hotel California"</strong> is the title song from the Eagles' album of the same name
			and was released as a single in February 1977. It is one of the best-known songs of the
			album-oriented rock era. Writing credits for the song are shared by Don Felder, Don Henley, and
			Glenn Frey. The Eagles' original recording of the song features Henley singing the lead vocals
			and concludes with an extended section of electric guitar interplay between Felder and Joe
			Walsh. The song has been given several interpretations by fans and critics alike, but the
			Eagles have described it as their "interpretation of the high life in Los Angeles". In the 2013
			documentary History of the Eagles, Henley said the song was about "a journey from innocence to
			experience...that's all".

		<h3>History and recognition</h3>
		<p>"Hotel California" topped the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart for one week in May 1977
			and peaked at number ten on the Adult Contemporary charts. Three months after its release, the
			single was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), representing
			one million copies shipped. The Eagles also won the 1977 Grammy Award for Record of the Year
			for "Hotel California" at the 20th Grammy Awards in 1978.</p>
		<p>In 2009, the song "Hotel California" was certified Platinum (Digital Sales Award) by the
			RIAA for sales of one million digital downloads.</p>
		<p>The song is rated highly in many rock music lists and polls; Rolling Stone magazine
			ranked it number 49 on its list of "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time". It is also one of
			The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. The song's guitar solo
			was voted the best solo of all time by readers of Guitarist magazine in 1998 and was ranked
			8th on Guitar Magazine's Top 100 Guitar Solos.</p>
		<p>As one of the group's most popular and well-known songs, "Hotel California" has been a
			concert staple for the band since its release. Performances of the song appear on the Eagles'
			1980 live album, simply called Live, and in an acoustic version on the 1994 Hell Freezes Over
			reunion concert CD and video release. The Hell Freezes Over version is performed using eight
			guitars and has a decidedly Spanish feel to it, with Don Felder's flamenco-inspired arrangement
			and intro. During the band's Farewell 1 Tour-Live from Melbourne, the song was performed in a
			manner closer to the original album version, but with a trumpet interlude in the beginning.</p>

		<h3>Cover art for single</h3>
		<p>The front cover art for the 45rpm release of the song was a reworked version of the Hotel
			California LP cover art, which used a photograph of the Beverly Hills Hotel by David Alexander,
			with design and art direction by Kosh.</p>

		<h3>Interpretation</h3>
		<p>The lyrics weave a surrealistic tale in which a weary traveler checks into a luxury
			hotel. The hotel at first appears inviting and tempting, but it turns out to be a nightmarish
			place where "you can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave". The song is an
			allegory about hedonism, self-destruction, and greed in the music industry of the late
			1970s. Don Henley called it "our interpretation of the high life in Los Angeles" and
			later reiterated: "It's basically a song about the dark underbelly of the American dream and
			about excess in America, which is something we knew a lot about." In 2008, Don Felder
			described the origins of the lyrics:</p>
		<blockquote><p>“ Don Henley and Glenn wrote most of the words. All of us kind of drove
			into L.A. at night. Nobody was from California, and if you drive into L.A. at night... you can
			just see this glow on the horizon of lights, and the images that start running through your
			head of Hollywood and all the dreams that you have, and so it was kind of about that... what we
			started writing the song about. Coming into L.A.... and from that 'Life in the Fast Lane' came
			out of it, and 'Wasted Time' and a bunch of other songs. ”</p></blockquote>
		<p>The term "colitas" in the first stanza means "little tails" in Spanish; in Mexican slang
			it refers to buds of the cannabis (marijuana) plant.</p>
